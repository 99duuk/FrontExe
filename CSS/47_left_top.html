    <p id="pos1">Since starting work on Star Wars Battlefront II, I’ve had the insane, only-dreamed-of opportunity to be a part of
        the Star Wars family. I have had deep conversations with the Lucasfilm team, superfans, and even proudly call
        George's son, Jett Lucas, a friend. All of this has allowed me to find new ways to appreciate this scene. Jett
        recently told me a very interesting character tidbit about Anakin, and the origin of his name: Anakin is based
        off the Greek goddess of inevitability, Ananke. This made me stop in my tracks. That was what I was always
        feeling. The slow, burning throttle of inevitability. It was inevitable that Luke and Vader would meet like
        this. It was inevitable that good would triumph over evil, no matter how long chaos reigned, because it was
        inevitable that someone would come along. YOU SEE!? YOU GET IT? (I'm sorry for yelling, but when I connected
        those dots, my mind exploded.)</p>
    <p id="pos2">Just look at the page. Literally the page with Sidious. Shmi is shown as pregnant before Palps even arrives.
        People see what they want to see but that whole crazy vision is not meant to imply anything Galaxy shattering.
        It's not meant to be taken literally.</p>
    <p id="pos3">After receiving the Sith title Darth Sidious, Palpatine studied the secrets of the Dark Side including his
        master's ability to generate life by influencing midi-chlorians. Plagueis may even have succeeded in this aim,
        given the strange circumstances surrounding the birth of Anakin Skywalker of Tatooine, but this did not matter
        to Palpatine, who had already taken his own apprentice in secret.</p>
